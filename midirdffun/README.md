# MIDI RDF Fun

These are the results of playing with [https://github.com/albertmeronyo/midi2rdf](https://github.com/albertmeronyo/midi2rdf). Read more about it in my blog entry [Converting between MIDI and RDF: readable MIDI and more fun with RDF](*******)

Remember that the scripts just experiments that I did for fun while on vacation at a summer beach house, so don't look for well-organized, modular code here.
